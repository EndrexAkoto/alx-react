Enzyme is a JavaScript Testing utility for React that makes it easier to test your React Components' output.
You can also manipulate, traverse, and in some ways simulate runtime given the output.

Enzyme's API is meant to be intuitive and flexible by mimicking jQuery's API for DOM manipulation
and traversal.

Upgrading from Enzyme 2.x or React < 16
===========

Are you here to check whether or not Enzyme is compatible with React 16? Are you currently using
Enzyme 2.x? Great! Check out our [migration guide](/docs/guides/migration-from-2-to-3.md) for help
moving on to Enzyme v3 where React 16 is supported.

### [Installation](/docs/installation/README.md)

To get started with enzyme, you can simply install it via npm. You will need to install enzyme
along with an Adapter corresponding to the version of react (or other UI Component library) you
are using. For instance, if you are using enzyme with React 16, you can run:

```bash
npm i --save-dev enzyme enzyme-adapter-react-16
```

Each adapter may have additional peer dependencies which you will need to install as well. For instance,
`enzyme-adapter-react-16` has peer dependencies on `react` and `react-dom`.

At the moment, Enzyme has adapters that provide compatibility with `React 16.x`, `React 15.x`,
`React 0.14.x` and `React 0.13.x`.

The following adapters are officially provided by enzyme, and have the following compatibility with
React:

| Enzyme Adapter Package | React semver compatibility |
| --- | --- |
| `enzyme-adapter-react-16` | `^16.4.0-0` |
| `enzyme-adapter-react-16.3` | `~16.3.0-0` |
| `enzyme-adapter-react-16.2` | `~16.2` |
| `enzyme-adapter-react-16.1` | <code>~16.0.0-0 &#124;&#124; ~16.1</code> |
| `enzyme-adapter-react-15` | `^15.5.0` |
| `enzyme-adapter-react-15.4` | `15.0.0-0 - 15.4.x` |
| `enzyme-adapter-react-14` | `^0.14.0` |
| `enzyme-adapter-react-13` | `^0.13.0` |

Finally, you need to configure enzyme to use the adapter you want it to use. To do this, you can use
the top level `configure(...)` API.

```js
import Enzyme from 'enzyme';
import Adapter from 'enzyme-adapter-react-16';

Enzyme.configure({ adapter: new Adapter() });
```
